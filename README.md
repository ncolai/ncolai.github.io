## Portfolio

[**MUSICAL WORKS**](https://soundcloud.com/nicolai-the-creative) 
> I am classically trained in piano and violin, and I compose in an ambient and orchestral style. I have also been fortunate enough to participate in several composition festivals including the Valencia International Performing Arts and ICEBERG Institute festivals. I have also been involved with a techno-arts residency called Mars College as well as been a resident artist at the 2025 Speculative Worlds residency in Komoro and ResArtis residency at Hub Feenix. [I created a music video for one of my livecode pieces for Harvard's 2025 Staff Art Show.](https://youtu.be/zSz371JFmv8?si=MQzrTkCV1EvgzHgH) Message me if you'd like to discuss more!

[**ALGO THEORY**](https://ncolai.github.io/algo-theory/) 
> I made an algorithmic visualizer for the 1st Summer of Math Exposition, and it was nominated for a Webby! This is a good showcase of my design sensibilities, front end skills, and also curriculum designing ability. 

[**PUBLISHED RESEARCH**](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Lai%2C+Nicholas) 
> At Stanford I majored in Computer Science and earned a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence. That training has taught me both software engineering and research skills. I have also worked at Harvard Medical School as a bioinformatics researcher, and was invited to AAI 2025 to present my web portal of the Immune Dictionary by Cui et al (2023). 

## Other Stuff

I am a huge nature lover and [have led outdoor trips in the Sierra Nevada for young'uns](https://www.sierranevadajourneys.org) as well as [outdoor trips while in college](https://rec.stanford.edu/adventure/stanford-pre-orientation-trips-spot). I am the sort of person who loves to put my money where my mouth is and get involved with things I'm passionate about. This has also led to many wild and fascinating adventures all over the world over the years! 

[I also like to read and occasionally write.](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/139899437-nick) [I published poetry in my college paper](https://stanforddaily.com/2021/04/04/ode-to-my-kindle/) and have a couple of pieces including a novel that I'd love to get published someday. Ahh, if only I could have more time and money to do things...

That's a lot of text! I am a big believer in face-to-face communication, so if you'd like to contact me, the best way to do so is [via email.](mailto:nicolaithecreative@gmail.com)

## Life Philosophy

Life is a painting, that you continuously paint throughout your life.

At various points the journey will be blissful, at other times tough. You don’t really know how things will turn out until the very end; all you can do is enjoy the process of figuring things out midway.

If you’re unhappy with the way things are going, you are the one who must change how things are. Nothing worth doing in life is easy, so don’t be afraid to work hard and make tough decisions.

Joy comes not through material things or abstract ideas but through living beings, in particular people who you lift up and who lift you up.

Be the person who you’d look up to as a child, not the person that you think others want you to be.
