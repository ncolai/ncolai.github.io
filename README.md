## Life Philosophy

Life is a painting, that you continuously paint throughout your life.

At various points the journey will be blissful, at other times tough. You don’t really know how things will turn out until the very end; all you can do is enjoy the process of figuring things out midway.

If you’re unhappy with the way things are going, you are the one who must change how things are. Nothing worth doing in life is easy, so don’t be afraid to work hard and make tough decisions.

Joy comes not through material things or abstract ideas but through living beings, in particular people who you lift up and who lift you up.

Be the person who you’d look up to as a child, not the person that you think others want you to be.
