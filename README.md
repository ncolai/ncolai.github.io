In my time on Earth, I've been very fortunate to have been involved in many different types of work and projects. If that's what you're here for, look no further. 

[Click here to see my composing portfolio.](https://soundcloud.com/nicolai-the-creative) I am well versed in piano and violin, and I compose in an ambient and orchestral style. Message me if you'd like to discuss more! 

[Here's my theatrical resume if you want to see my acting background.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nnquDaVWkyvAtYG0D7AVxjXnjeUU-r-D/view?usp=sharing) I have acted, danced, and directed theater in various capacities, mostly around New York. 

[Here's a collection of algorithmic visualizations I made for the first Summer of Math Exposition.](https://deepdaydreams.github.io/algo-theory/) This is a good showcase of my design sensibilities, front end skills, and also curriculum designing ability. 

[I am also a published researcher, and here's the proof.](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Lai%2C+Nicholas) At Stanford I majored in Computer Science and earned a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence.

## Other Stuff

I am a huge nature lover and [have led outdoor trips in the Sierra Nevada for young'uns](https://www.sierranevadajourneys.org) as well as [outdoor trips while in college](https://rec.stanford.edu/adventure/stanford-pre-orientation-trips-spot). I am the sort of person who loves to put my money where my mouth is and get involved with things I'm passionate about. This has also led to many wild and fascinating adventures all over the world over the years! 

[I also like to read and occasionally write.](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/139899437-nick) [I published poetry in my college paper](https://stanforddaily.com/2021/04/04/ode-to-my-kindle/) and have a couple of pieces including a novel that I'd love to get published someday. Ahh, if only I could have more time and money to do things...

That's a lot of text! I am a big believer in face-to-face communication, so if you'd like to contact me, the best way to do so is [via email.](mailto:nicholaslai749@gmail.com)

## Life Philosophy

Life is a painting, that you continuously paint throughout your life.

At various points the journey will be blissful, at other times tough. You don’t really know how things will turn out until the very end; all you can do is enjoy the process of figuring things out midway.

If you’re unhappy with the way things are going, you are the one who must change how things are. Nothing worth doing in life is easy, so don’t be afraid to work hard and make tough decisions.

Joy comes not through material things or abstract ideas but through living beings, in particular people who you lift up and who lift you up.

Be the person who you’d look up to as a child, not the person that you think others want you to be.
